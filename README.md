 |tPRiors|: Bayesian prevalence estimation with prior elicitation. Current link: https://publicandonehealth.shinyapps.io/tPRiors/. The shiny app can be downloaded from github. Then it can be run locally in the computer without internet access. The steps to perform this locally will be uploaded soon.

The development of this application has been funded by the University of Thessaly partially through the H2020 EU project 6614 - «unCoVer: Unravelling Data for Rapid Evidence-Based Response to COVID-19». More details can be found in the upcoming manuscript "tPRiors: A tool for prior elicitation and obtaining posterior distributions of true disease prevalence"
